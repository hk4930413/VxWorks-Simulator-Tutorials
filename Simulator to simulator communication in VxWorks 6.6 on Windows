•	Simulator to simulator communication in vxworks 6.6 using Wind River workbench 3.0 on windows

Implementation method in vxworks 6.6 

1. Firstly install the wrtap drivers (go to vxworks 6.6 simulator guide page no 66)
2. Then start the simnetd service by running install_directory\vxworks-6.6\host\x86-win32\bin\simnet-ints.exe as an administrator (go to vxworks 6.6 simulator guide page no 51)
3. Run the windriver network daemon services from services program using admin privileges 
4. Turn off firewall options (type windows defender firewall with advanced security and then turn them off)
5. Edit the simulator (vxsim0) properties. Go to advance boot parameters > boot device > simnet and then assign the ip 192.168.200.1 in “Inet on ethernet” option, Then write “-ni simnet” in other vxworks simulator options in vxworks simulator miscellenous option in simulator properties. Edit the simulator (vxsim1) properties. Go to advance boot parameters > boot device > simnet and then assign the ip 192.168.200.2 in “Inet on ethernet” option, Then write “-ni simnet” in other vxworks simulator options in vxworks simulator miscellenous option in simulator properties.
7. Note that ip should be of same subnet.
8. Make an image project and then make an empty c file in it. Then go to kernel configurations, add ping components (INCLUDE_PING) in it. Then build the image and then configure the simulator with this image.
9. Ping the simulator ip from other simulator.
